Overview

Introduction
............

The application note shows the use of the XMOS Ethernet library. The
library allows multiple clients to access the Ethernet hardware. This
application note uses the gigabit RGMII Ethernet MAC which uses 8
logical cores on a single tile (although one of those core can be
shared with the application). The Ethernet library also provides
100Mbit MAC components which consume less resource on the xCORE
device.

The gigabit MAC can handle line rate data packets through to the
application layer and provides high performance streaming data, accurate
packet timestamping, priority queuing and 802.1Qav traffic shaping.

RGMII provides the data transfer signals
between the Ethernet PHY (Physical Layer Device or transceiver) and
the xCORE device. The RGMII layer receives packets of data which are
then routed by an Ethernet MAC layer to multiple processes running on
the xCORE. SMI provides the management interface between the PHY and
the xCORE device.

The application communicates with the Ethernet MAC that drives the RGMII
data interface to the PHY. A separate PHY driver configures the PHY
via the SMI serial interface.


Gigabit Ethernet library demo
-----------------------------


The Makefile
............

The demo in this note uses the XMOS Ethernet library and shows a
simple program communicating with the Ethernet library.

To start using the Ethernet library, you need to add ``lib_ethernet``
to you Makefile::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_ethernet ...

This demo also gets the MAC address out of the xCORE OTP rom and is
for the sliceKIT. So the Makefile also includes the OTP reading library
(``lib_otpinfo``)::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_otpinfo ...


Allocating hardware resources
.............................

The Ethernet library requires the user to declare the ports that the
RGMII MAC uses to communicate with the Ethernet PHY.
These ports are fixed on the xCORE-200 series so in the main program
they are declared using the ``RGMII_PORTS_INITIALIZER`` macro provided
by the library. This means the application just needs to declare a
structure in ``main.xc`` to pass to the MAC component.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: rgmii_ports_t
   :end-before: p_smi_mdio

The application needs to control the reset line of the PHY and
configure the phy via the MDIO Serial Management Interface (SMI):

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: p_smi_mdio
   :end-on: p_eth_reset

The final ports used in the application
are the ones to access the internal OTP
memory on the xCORE. These ports are fixed and can be intialized with
the ``OTP_PORTS_INITIALIZER`` macro supplied by the ``lib_otpinfo``
OTP reading library.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: // These ports are for accessing the OTP memory
   :end-on: otp_ports

The application main() function
...............................

The main function in the program sets up the tasks in the application.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: int main

The ``rgmii_ethernet_mac`` and ``rgmii_ethernet_mac_config`` tasks
communicate with the PHY and connect to the
application via the three interfaces. The previously declared RGMII
ports as arguments as well as an argument that determines whether the
802.1Qav traffic shaper is enabled.

The ``smi`` task is part of the Ethernet library and controls the SMI
protocol to configure the PHY. It connects to the
``ar8035_phy_driver`` task which connects configuration of the PHY

The RGMII MAC is split into two tasks so that other tasks can be
placed on the same logical core as the config task. In this example,
the PHY driver task is placed on that core.

In this example, the ``rgmii_ethernet_mac`` task has two ``null``
arguments. These are two optional streaming channels parameters that
are not used in this example but  can be used for high priority, high
speed traffic (see the Ethernet library user guide for details).

|newpage|

The PHY driver
..............

The PHY drive task connects to both the Ethernet MAC (via the
``ethernet_cfg_if`` interface for configuration) and the SMI driver
(via the ``smi_if`` interface):

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: [[combinable]]
   :end-before:  int main

The first action the drive does is wait for the PHY to power up and
then configure the PHY. This is done via library functions provided by
the Ethernet library.

The main body of the drive is an infinite loop that periodically
reacts to a timer event in an xC ``select`` statement. A a set period
it checks the state of the PHY over SMI and then informs the MAC of
this state via the ``eth.set_link_state`` call. This way the MAC can
know about link up/down events or change of link speed.

ICMP Packet Processing
......................

The packet processing in the application is handled by the
``icmp_server`` task which is defined in the file ``icmp.xc``. This
function connects to the ethernet MAC via a transmit, receive and
configuration interface:

.. literalinclude:: icmp.xc
   :start-on: [[combinable]]
   :end-on: {

The first thing the task performs is configuring its connection to the
MAC. The MAC address is configured by reading a MAC address out of OTP
(using the ``otp_board_info_get_mac`` function from the OTP reading
library) and then calling the ``set_macaddr`` interface function:

.. literalinclude:: icmp.xc
   :start-on: unsigned char mac_address[MACADDR_NUM_BYTES];
   :end-on: cfg.set_macaddr

After this, the task configures filters to determine which type of
packets is will receive from the MAC:

.. literalinclude:: icmp.xc
   :start-on: memcpy(macaddr_filter.addr
   :end-before: debug_printf

The task then proceeds into an infinite loop that waits for a packet
from the MAC and then processes it:

.. literalinclude:: icmp.xc
   :start-on: while (1)

The xC ``select`` statement will wait for the event
``rx.packet_ready()`` which is a receive notification from the MAC
(see the Ethernet library user guide for details of the ethernet
receive interface). When a packet arrives the ``rx.get_packet`` call
will retreive the packet from the MAC.

After the packet is processed the ``tx.send_packet`` call will send
the created reponse packet to the MAC.

Details of the packet processing functions ``is_valid_arp_packet``,
``build_arp_response``, ``is_valid_icmp_packet`` and
``build_icmp_response`` can be found in the ``icmp.xc`` file. The
functions implement the ICMP protocol.

Demo Hardware Setup
--------------------

 * To run the demo, connect the PC to the XTAG USB debug adapter to
   xCORE-200 explorer XSYS connector
 * Connect the XTAG to the host PC using a USB cable
 * Connect the ethernet jack to the host PC or to the network switch
   using an ethernet cable.

Launching the demo device
-------------------------

Once the application source code is imported into the tools you can
edit the demo to configure the IP address the ICMP code uses. This is
declared as a data structure in ``main.xc`` (which is then passed to
the ``icmp_server`` function)::

  static unsigned char ip_address[4] = {192, 168, 1, 178};

Alter this value to an IP address that works on your network.

You can now build the project which will generate the binary file required to run the demo application.
Once the application has been built you need to download the
application code onto the xCORE-200 explorer.
Here you use the tools to load the application over JTAG onto the xCORE device.

 * Select **Run Configuration**.
 * In **Main** menu, enable **xSCOPE** in Target I/O options.
 * In **XScope** menu, enable **Offline [XScope] Mode**.
 * Click **Apply** and then **Run**.

When the processor has finished booting you will see the following text in the xTIMEcomposer console window when **ping**-ed from the host. 

.. _fig_ping_response:

.. figure:: images/ping_response.*
   :scale: 85%
   :align: center

   Response on xTIMEcomposer console for **Ping**

|newpage|

.. figure:: images/host_ping_response.*
   :scale: 85%
   :align: center

   Response on Host PC for **Ping**

On the above `ping` response on host, out of 40 packets transmitted to device first 15 packet couldn't able to reach the device. During this period, device will respond as **ARP packet received**. 
After that device (remaining 35 packets) responds as **ICMP packet received**. (:ref:`fig_ping_response`)
