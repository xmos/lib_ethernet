100Mbit Ethernet RMII example

*******
Summary
*******

Ethernet connectivity is an essential part of the explosion of connected
devices known collectively as the Internet of Things (IoT).  XMOS technology is
perfectly suited to these applications - offering future proof and reliable
ethernet connectivity whilst offering the flexibility to interface to a huge
variety of "Things".

This example that demonstrates the use
of the XMOS Ethernet library to create a layer 2 ethernet MAC
interface on an XMOS multicore microcontroller.

The code associated with this application note provides an example of
using the Ethernet Library to provide a framework for the creation of an
ethernet Reduced Media Independent Interface (RMII) and MAC interface for
100Mbps.

The applcation note uses XMOS libraries to provide a simple IP stack
capable of responding to an ICMP ping message. The code used in the
application note provides both RMII communication to the PHY and a MAC
transport layer for ethernet packets and enables a client to connect
to it and send/receive packets.
