Summary
*******

``lib_ethernet`` is a library providing implementations of the Ethernet MAC layer,
designed to support network communication by handling data transmission and reception at the Media Access Control level.
It provides complete, software defined, Ethernet MAC implementations that support
10/100/1000 Mb/s data rates and are designed to IEEE Std 802.3-2002 specifications.

 * 10/100 Mb/s Ethernet MAC
 * 10/100 Mb/s Ethernet MAC with real-time features
 * 10/100/1000 Mb/s Ethernet MAC with real-time features (xCORE-200 XE/XEF)
 * Raw MII interface

********
Features
********

  * 10/100/1000 Mb/s full-duplex operation
  * Media Independent Interface (MII), Reduced Media Independent Interface (RMII) and Reduced Gigabit Media Independent Interface (RGMII) to the physical layer
  * Configurable Ethertype and MAC address filters for unicast, multicast and broadcast addresses
  * Frame alignment, CRC, and frame length error detection
  * IEEE 802.1Q Audio Video Bridging priority queueing and credit based traffic shaper
  * Support for VLAN-tagged frames
  * Transmit and receive frame timestamp support for IEEE 1588 and 802.1AS
  * Management Data Input/Output (MDIO) Interface for physical layer management
